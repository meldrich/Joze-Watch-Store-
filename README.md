# GUIDE FOR MODULE 2
#The file that I updated is the JoseStore.php, you can see the previous version that I did as instructed on Module 1 on the History tab of the JoseStore.php and the updated version is the instructions I followed on the Module 2


# GUIDE FOR MODULE 3
#I updated the name and the overall structure of JoseStore.php and turned it into index.php since it's more likely used and a lot easier to make changes with. I also update the consistent css for header and added 3 links which is the home, products, and stocks. I also updated the syntax on footer.php which I removed the p tags and made echo shorthand for the date. I also added the stock_monitor for this module and followed every code requirement. Lastly for products.php I only removed the storeName variable and removed some comments and changed the discount value.
